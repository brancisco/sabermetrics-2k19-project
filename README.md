# AWPS - Aguirre's Wager Point System

## Description & Inspiration

Below I implement a closed point rating system. I’ll define a “closed point” rating system to be a rating system that distributes a finite number of points to all players in the MLB. These points will be transferred between pitchers and batters each time a pitcher and batter face off.

I was inspired to create this rating system by the Hungarian-American physicist Arpad Elo who invented the Elo Rating System. His system was used to rate chess players based on their relative skill levels. I expect that the Elo Rating System was a bit simpler to implement because the points were transferred between two players who played the same position (both are chess players). The point system I am implementing will be transferring points between two players who play different positions - pitcher and batter, and will have to take into account different events.
