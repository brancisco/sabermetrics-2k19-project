## Description

For this final project I intend to create my own closed point rating system. I’ll define a “closed point” rating system to be a rating system that distributes a finite number of points to all players in the MLB. These points will be transferred between pitchers and batters each time a pitcher and batter face off. I will call my rating system Aguirre’s Wager Point System, or AWPS for short. I was inspired to create this rating system by the Hungarian-American physicist Arpad Elo who invented the [Elo Rating System][wiki elo rating system].
